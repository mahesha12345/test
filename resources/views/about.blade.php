			                               <p>Dear Parents, I welcome you to the Nice International School, which strives to be one of the best pre-schools in the country. The school tries to give a rich blend of learning, fun, play and other activities like art, dance, music, theatre etc. The school is geared up to give one of the best facilities for the child's all round development.</p>
			                               <p>We have attracted one of the best talents, for our teaching and other staff to ensure that your child gets the best. We do not believe that by getting the best staff is an end in itself. We plan to have continuous learning / training for teachers to ensure that they remain the best consistently over the years.</p>
			                              <p>We want to be a transparent school to ensure that the parents get to understand how we go about achieving our objective of being the best pre-school in the country. We not only want to listen to the parents and shall take their suggestions for improvement seriously. We shall not become the best school in the country unless we give importance for nature and environment that shall be one of our principal objectives. We would like to be evaluated at the end of the year by the smile and happiness of the children attending the school than any other yardstick.</p>
			                              <p>Sincerely,</p>
