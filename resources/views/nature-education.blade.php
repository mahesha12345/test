                <P>Everything around us is connected to nature. When experiences with nature are embedded in the preschool curriculum and daily routine, children benefit physically, emotionally, and intellectually as they have new experiences, exercise their bodies, and enjoy the feeling of freedom that comes from being connected to the natural world. Children can turn over a rock or a piece of wood and find insects, worms, plant roots, and fungi. They can look at clouds or collect leaves and gain an appreciation of the variety of forms and textures in nature. They can hear birds or feel the wind and become aware of a whole sensory world beyond the classroom door. They feel joy.<br></P>
                 <h4 class="top">Benefits of Including Nature in the Curriculum:<br></h4>
                 <p>An emerging body of research shows the harmful effects of children’s separation from nature and the benefits of strengthening those ties. There are implications for children’s physical, intellectual, and social-emotional development.</p>
            
                 <h4 class="top">Intellectual development:<br></h4>
                 <p>Efforts to limit children’s exposure to the media indicate that children play more creatively in green space. As children explore the sensory variety of the outdoors, they learn important concepts in science (e.g., the living habits of plants and animals; the physical properties of different materials such as water, soil, and stone) and ecology (e.g., the importance of preserving natural resources; how their actions affect the environment). Exposure to nature also enhances young children’s language development. Children inquire about the names of the things they investigate and seek words to describe the processes they observe. Time in nature is also positively associated with sustained attention . Being outdoors helps children release energy, which allows them to focus on quieter tasks; further, the interest that nature inherently holds for children invites concentration. Finally, experiences in nature enhance the intellectual richness and complexity of children’s collaborative play. They incorporate what they learn about the natural world into their pretend play scenarios.</p>
               <h4 class="top">Setting the Stage for Nature Learning:</h4>
                 <p>Nature learning happens naturally whenever children are outdoors. They experience and learn about nature whether enjoying free play or a group activity. Nature activities can also take place indoors, such as growing plants from seeds. In this section, we look at how you can enhance children’s learning during all these different types of experiences.</p>
